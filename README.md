The APP will call a weather API and collect the outside temperature in your area and will send a text to your phone with outside temp and feels like temp


Me and my fiance like to go out for a morning run but we hate to ask google everytime we have to go out. So I wrote this script which runs on the cloud everyday at 9am and gets the real time weather data and sends an automatic text to our phones telling the weather outside is whatever and temp is ___C/F and feels like is __C/F. So that we know what kind of clothes to wear to our jog/run.
